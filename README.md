#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

This project consists of two parts:

1. The Restaurant Reviews application (this repo).
2. The server containing the restaurant data (a separate repo).

## Spin Up the Server

1. Clone the [Server Repo locally](https://github.com/lhornsby/mws-restaurant-stage-3)
2. Follow the ` Getting Started` instructions to install dependencies, then
3. Start the server.

## Spin Up the App

1. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
2. Run `npm i` in the Restaurant Reviews directory to install its dependencies.
3. Go to `http://localhost:8000` to load the Restaurant Review app.
